##  Clean Programing Lessons
- Meaningful variable names for user readability and clarity. Removes the need for adding comments to explain code.
- Naming conventions for functions should be in imperative mood, i.e "This function will...". This improves understanding of the functions purpose for external readers or code reviewers.
- Use Don't Repeat Yourself(DRY) principle to write good instead of just working code. Don't have condition checking programs redundant and check the same condition twice.
