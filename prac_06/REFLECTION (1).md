# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

With simpler programs from the beginning of the subject I was just trying to memorise the structure of code without 
fully understanding the logic behind them. With the topics increasing in difficulty I have tried to dedicate more time 
in understanding what a program should actually do. 

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to stop seeing the extension tasks as optional and start completing them as study for the 
final exam. I should start doing these now and not leave them till SWOTVAC as I will be busy with other
subjects as well.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been on top of completing the lecture videos and activities before the Tuesday seminars. This
has been helpful with the increase in workload over the trimester.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should stop leaving the pracs uncompleted for the weekend as I forget where I left a program. I should
aim to finish the pracs on the same day and leave code reviews to the weekend. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
