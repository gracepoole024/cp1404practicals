# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I always went 13-10 min over the estimate.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It got netter for the smaller tasks, I could estimate those well. Longer programs I'd underestimate.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt how much time I should leve to complete the practical, and allow for more time than what I think.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I have learnt that there are mistakes or functionality issues in my code that I don't pick up on but others do. For example,
the SRP and DRY principles are skills I need more practice at and other people reviewing my code shows me what I could
have done better. It helped with leaning by example.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I have learnt to code better, as I see mistakes in their code and remember to fix that for mine. For example,
full stops for docstings I kept forgetting with my code but when I was looking for errors in others code I am reminded 
that I also have the same mistakes.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Good Code Review 1](https://github.com/Harsh04105/cp1404practicals/pull/5#event-21002300105)

### Explanation

I think this was a good code review as there were alot of positive feedback that I could provide, while also providing
constructive comments for small formatting issues. This program helped me look for positive comments as sometimes I would
get caught in only the negative.

### Good Code Review 2

[Good Code Review 2](https://github.com/jd115461/cp1404practicals/pull/1#event-20541959230)

### Explanation

This was the first code review I did and I believe I commented on all the things that this person wanted me too. I also 
was able to leave positive feedback. This was also a good learning experience for me as the first review,
as it made me realise mistakes in my own code.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would have one less task in week 9 as it was a pretty busy week assessment wise for all subjects. I liked the car/
taki task and I understand that the taxi simulator is meant to help with assignment 2 but, the project management task in
week 7 already does that.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think completing them early in the week and going back on Sunday to check them helped with my formatting of my pracs.
This also let me have more time to work on the assignments.
