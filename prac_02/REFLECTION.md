# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100% up to and including to week 2. 

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I take all of Sunday to watch the lectures, take notes, and do the activities.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think I have been doing well in attempting to write a program independently first before asking for help.
I am not confident in writing programs and have a habit to immediately ask for guidance. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to start making time to do the extension tasks not just the deliverables. I am not strong in programming
and I can only improve that with practice. 

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I need to start reviewing my work before I submit it. From prac 1 some of my presentation wasn't correct, for 
example "TODO" comments weren't deleted. 

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I read the entire prac instructions first before I start writing code. This helps in actually completing the 
task criteria and not missing the point of the prac.
